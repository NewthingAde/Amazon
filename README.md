## Overview
This is a Amazon Clone from scratch challenge by [CleverProgrammers](https://github.com/CleverProgrammers) which I coded from scratch using CleverProgrammers guidinace.

## The Project Challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
 
 
## My process
The project was really challenging for me being the first e-commerce site i built. It took me four weeks to complete better. I learnt Redux, firebase hosting and I was able to understand how some dependencies and Api's.

 
## Built with
- HTML5 
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Boostrap
- React  (https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Redux
- Material-Ul (https://material-ui.com)
- Javascript
- Firebase
- Firebase hosting
 


## What I learned
During the course of the project, I understand Redux, firebase hosting, material-uI and React.Js. The project has motivated me more to take more challenging projects. 

 ## Continued development
I will love to focus more on the Backend and Database for the project and other projects too.
